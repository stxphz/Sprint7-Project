# Sprint7-Project

Project on Sprint 7 - Exploring and Cleaning Data with Pandas

Sprint 7 project is about Instacart. Instacart is a grocery delivery platform where customers can place a grocery order and have it delivered to them, similar to how Uber Eats and Door Dash work. This particular dataset was publicly released by Instacart in 2017 for a Kaggle competition.

The dataset provided have modified from the original by Practicum. They reduced the size of the dataset so calculations run faster and introduced missing and duplicate values. They were also careful to preserve the distributions of the original data when making the changes.

The necessary datasets that were provided are named: /aisles.csv, /departments.csv, /instacart_orders.csv, /order_products.csv, and /products.csv

The goal of this project is to clean up the data and prepare a report that gives insight into the shopping habits of Instacart customers.
This project also required good visulazations to communicate my findings from the datasets.
